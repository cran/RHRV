\usage{
RecurrencePlot(
  HRVData,
  numberPoints = 1000,
  embeddingDim = NULL,
  timeLag = NULL,
  radius = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{HRVData}{Data structure that stores the beats register and information related to it}

\item{numberPoints}{Number of points from the RR time series to be used in the RQA computation. Default: 1000 heartbeats.}

\item{embeddingDim}{Integer denoting the dimension in which we shall embed the RR time series.}

\item{timeLag}{Integer denoting the number of time steps that will be use to construct the 
Takens' vectors.}

\item{radius}{Maximum distance between two phase-space points to be considered a recurrence.}

\item{...}{Additional plotting parameters.}
}
\description{
Plot the recurrence matrix of the RR time series.

This function is based on the \code{\link[nonlinearTseries]{recurrencePlot}} function from the 
nonlinearTseries package.
